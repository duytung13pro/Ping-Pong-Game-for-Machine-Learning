Ping Pong is my creation of the two paddle game of Pong. When one of players reach 10 points, the game will end


PongEvolution is my implementation of AI model. The game is currently in its early stages, featuring a single paddle that bounces off three surrounding walls. 
To expedite the AI development process, I initiated the game with 100 paddles. 
Paddles failing to return the ball will be removed from the game. 
Should any paddle be removed, the generation count for the remaining paddles will increase by one, indicating progression to a subsequent generation.
